Hi,

I'm learning to code using processing tutorials I find on YouTube and converting them to Python, specifically Py5, a python version of processing.

I use talon voice to control my computer with voice commands.

I also use Project gameface, a head tracking mouse control software developed by google.

I'm excited about the future of open source software and technology.
